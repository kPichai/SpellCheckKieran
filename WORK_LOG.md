Initially we considered things like linear search and binary search but ultimately decided that a map would be the most efficient way of sorting out this problem. However, what me and tony discussed was one main problem: how to assign each string to a unique value in a map. This would have to involve some sort of function that converts strings into unique ints. |

Essentially what a hashmap does is create a key/item relationship in which if we created a hashmap that aligns a string with an int, we could use the string to get check if its in the dictionary, an O(1) lookup like a map. |

However, my code didn't work and runs into int overflow issues and also issues with using the indicies of the map. I'm going to try to fix this on my next iteration. |
| Sept. 26 | 12:45pm - 1:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I talked to tony about using a hash map and talked to Mr. Blick on how to implement one. My approach utilizes a mathematical method called hashString (not from the hash library, but one i coded) that uses prime numbers and the ascii values of a string to hash it into a unique code. The issue with this code is that it overflows even long ints, super space inefficient. If I use this method to hash 140000 element long array in which my hash maps would be essentially 1000000000 long and storing longs, then I'd be using gigabytes of data just to store this map (extremely space inefficient but very time efficient). As it is only O(n) to set up the map and O(v) to check if something is in the dictionary (if v = length of the string we are searching for). |
| Sept. 26 |  1:15pm - 1:45pm  | I then started discussing new solutions with the class. Me and Tony talked about a algorithm which turns the dictionary into a tree. This essentially works by taking each string in the dictionary letter by letter and making a tree that increases in size, however the trick to this tree is that it would remove any edges that lead to combinations of chars that don't create words. Essentially, instead of going to A -> ap -> it would go from A straight to Ape. This increases the efficiency of searching for a word, however the inital setup time is very computationally heavy (the advantage is that to find a word it'll be O(v) where v = number of chars in the string we are searching for). I then started thinking of another idea which utilizes a map of map, this is similar to my initial idea but much MUCH more space efficient. Essentially there is a map of chars (1-26 letters in the alphabet) then it continues down in levels until you make words. Theoretically this would also have an O(v) runtime. |

I've tried reducing the size of the numbers my hash function generates but despite this it still generates out of bounds numbers. I'll need to either further optimize this function or rethink my data structure that i'm using. I also swithced from a string array to a boolean array as it should be more space efficient. |
